# Project-Summary

Starting from July 4, 2016, up until today, Junocam has been orbiting Jupiter and capturing snaps of the Jovian surface. Seeking a feasible approach to heightening astronomic enthusiasm among youths and leveraging the fullest scientific significance of the images, we built ‘Eloquent Juno’, a web app focusing on artistic retouching and machine-learning based scientific labeling on raw Junocam images. In addition, one can compare and download raw and edited images, add quotes, play quizzes, solve puzzles and generate mesmerizing music videos. And beauty is not to be confined, right? Therefore, our app comes up with the scope of sharing the images on almost any popular social platform.

# Our Solution

Once the user enters into the Web-app interface, a beautifully curated, dark themed page is displayed with the options of filtering Junocam images on the basis of title, mission name, date etc. and sorting the images chronologically. Upon clicking the “Apply Filter” button, the app scrapes out relevant images and displays them in the right editor.

The App saliently presents the following features:

1) Basic Editing - Besides changing standard properties of the images namely brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and sharpness, users can add texts upon images, apply color filters and add random shapes. 

2) Scientific Analysis - Leveraging the power of Machine Learning, our app is capable of analyzing Junocam images from a scientific point of view and extracting features on Jupiter surface including The Great Red Spot, Cloud ripples, Swirl Cyclones and Moon Shadow.

3) Quotes - With one tap, you will be able to add interesting randomized or categorized quotes on Junocam images.

4) Background Modification - The app enables you to add custom backgrounds to the images which will be used as alpha masks wrapping the images and turning them more attractive.

5) Comparison of Images - After glamorizing the images with the editor, you’d like to compare it with what it was like before, right? Here comes an elegant slider-based interface to compare the original and edited image.

6) Image Download - You may also save your favorite raw or edited images in your device.

7) Music Lyrics Video - Possibly the most exquisite feature of our app is the automatic generation of Music videos combining scraped music audio and lyrics and edited Junocam images. What could ever be a better way to pique someone’s interest in Jupiter?

8) Scientific Quizzes - Grab the chances of topping the leaderboard by taking part in quizzes based on Junocam images.

9) Amusing Puzzles - Puzzles are fun, right? How'd it feel to solve daunting puzzles generated automatically from Junocam images. Our app scrapes the images, splits them into grid and eventually scatters them to form a puzzle. You can then swap or move the pieces to solve and enjoy.

10) User Manual - We believe, without a well documented user manual, even the most user-friendly application turns into an obscure one at least for the novel visitors. Therefore, we included a detailed user manual on how to use the features conveniently. Click on the right and left arrows buttons to traverse through a detailed guidelines with associated images.

# Hackathon Journey

Strengthening our interconnections, boosting our confidence and making us aware of our technical lackings, this challenge has served as a blessing for us. Under the kindest supervision of local authorities, we managed to develop and deploy a web app from scratch. Adding one feature after another was a challenging activity indeed. Besides, two of our team members put utmost effort on the presentation and video editing part. The greatest hurdle on the journey was the unbelievable time crunch. Finishing the web app and finalising all features within time seemed quite daunting. And the largest motivation behind the whole hackathon was the urge of representing our country on an international stage. In a nutshell, the journey could not be more memorable. We’ll look forward to such challenges in future.
